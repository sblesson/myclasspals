        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>

          USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
          the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
          indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
          limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other
          information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
          privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
          inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party

          advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
          fails of its essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
          limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
          means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these
          states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent
          permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>

          AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of

          Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and
          their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims

          respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of

          non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of
          dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
          limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or
          undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service
          will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
          compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or
          services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
          reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
          can or will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
          company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
          express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
          Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
          included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
          error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
          warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
          consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
          not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
          set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
          enforceable under applicable law.

          EU-U.S. Privacy Shield legal framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
          Shield legal framework, and any equivalent legal framework that may
          apply between the UK and the United States. “Policies” means the

          https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy.html.
          “Processor Terms” means: (a) where Google is a party to the Agreement,
          the processor terms available at
          https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/; or (b) where
          the Agreement is between Customer and a third party reseller, such
          terms reflecting a controller-processor relationship (if any) as
          agreed between the Customer and the third party reseller. “Terms
          Effective Date” means, as applicable: (a) 25 May 2018, if Customer
          clicked to accept or the parties otherwise agreed to these Controller
          Terms before or on such date; or (b) the date on which Customer
          clicked to accept or the parties otherwise agreed to these Controller
          Terms, if such date is after 25 May 2018. “UK GDPR” means the EU GDPR
          as amended and incorporated into UK law under the UK European Union

          these Controller Terms have the meanings given in the GDPR. 2.3 Any

          examples of a particular concept. 2.4 Any reference to a legal
          framework, statute or other legislative enactment is a reference to it
          as amended or re-enacted from time to time. 3. Application of these
          Controller Terms 3.1 Application of Data Protection Legislation These
          Controller Terms will only apply to the extent that the Data
          Protection Legislation applies to the processing of Controller
          Personal Data. 3.2 Application to Data Sharing Setting These
          Controller Terms will only apply to the Data Sharing Setting for which
          the parties agreed to these Controller Terms (for example, the Data
          Sharing Setting for which Customer clicked to accept these Controller
          Terms). 3.3 Duration These Controller Terms will apply from the Terms
          Effective Date and continue while Google or Customer processes
          Controller Personal Data, after which these Controller Terms will
          automatically terminate. 4. Roles and Restrictions on Processing 4.1
          Independent Controllers Each party: (a) is an independent controller
          of Controller Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (b)
          will individually determine the purposes and means of its processing
          of Controller Personal Data; and (c) will comply with the obligations
          applicable to it under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to
          the processing of Controller Personal Data. 4.2 Restrictions on
          Processing Section 4.1 (Independent Controllers) will not affect any
          restrictions on either party’s rights to use or otherwise process

          Personal Data shared pursuant to the Data Sharing Setting and at all
          times will bear the burden of proof in establishing such compliance.
          5. Data Transfers Either party may transfer Controller Personal Data
          to third countries if it complies with the provisions on the transfer
          of personal data to third countries in the Data Protection
          Legislation. 6. Liability If Google is: (a) party to the Agreement and
          the Agreement is governed by the laws of: (i) a state of the United
          States of America, then, notwithstanding anything else in the
          Agreement, the total liability of either party towards the other party
          under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be limited to
          the maximum monetary or payment-based amount at which that party’s
          liability is capped under the Agreement (for clarity, any exclusion of
          indemnification claims from the Agreement’s limitation of liability
          will not apply to indemnification claims under the Agreement relating
          to the Data Protection Legislation); or (ii) a jurisdiction that is
          not a state of the United States of America, then the liability of the
          parties under or in connection with these Controller Terms will be
          subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability in the
          Agreement; or (b) not party to the Agreement, to the extent permitted
          by applicable law, Google will not be liable for Customer’s lost
          revenues or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or
          punitive damages, even if Google or its Affiliates have been advised
          of, knew or should have known that such damages do not satisfy a
          remedy. Google’s (and its Affiliates’) total cumulative liability to
          Customer or any other party for any loss or damages resulting from
          claims, damages or actions arising out of or relating to these
          Controller Terms will not exceed $500 (USD). 7. Priority 7.1 Effect of
          these Controller Terms If Google is party to the Agreement and there
          is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of these Controller
          Terms and the remainder of the Agreement then, subject to Sections 4.2
          (Restrictions on Processing) and 7.2 (Processor Terms), the terms of
          these Controller Terms will govern. Subject to the amendments in these
          Controller Terms, the Agreement between Google and Customer remains in
          full force and effect. 7.2 Processor Terms These Controller Terms will
          not replace or affect any Processor Terms. For the avoidance of doubt,
          if Customer is party to the Processor Terms in connection with the
          Measurement Services, the Processor Terms will continue to apply to
          the Measurement Services notwithstanding that these Controller Terms
          apply to Controller Personal Data processed pursuant to the Data
          Sharing Setting. 8. Changes to these Controller Terms 8.1 Changes to
          Controller Terms Google may change these Controller Terms if the
          change: (a) is required to comply with applicable law, applicable
          regulation, a court order or guidance issued by a governmental
          regulator or agency; or (b) does not: (i) seek to alter the
          categorisation of the parties as independent controllers of Controller
          Personal Data under the Data Protection Legislation; (ii) expand the
          scope of, or remove any restrictions on, either party’s rights to use
          or otherwise process Controller Personal Data; or (iii) have a
          material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by
          Google. 8.2 Notification of Changes If Google intends to change these
          Controller Terms under Section 8.1(a) and such change will have a
          material adverse impact on Customer, as reasonably determined by
          Google, then Google will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform
          Customer at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required
          to comply with applicable law, applicable regulation, a court order or
          guidance issued by a governmental regulator or agency) before the
          change will take effect. If Customer objects to any such change,
          Customer may switch off the Data Sharing Setting. 9. Additional
          Provisions 9.1 This Section 9 (Additional Provisions) will only apply
          where Google is not party to the Agreement. 9.2 Each party will comply
          with its obligations under these Controller Terms with reasonable
          skill and care. 9.3 Neither party will use or disclose the other
          party's Confidential Information without the other's prior written
          consent except for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing
          its obligations under these Controller Terms or if required by law,
          regulation or court order; in which case, the party being compelled to
          disclose Confidential Information will give the other party as much
          notice as is reasonably practicable prior to disclosing the
          Confidential Information. 9.4 To the fullest extent permitted by
          applicable law, except as expressly provided for in these Controller
          Terms, Google makes no other warranty of any kind whether express,
          implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
          warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use and
          non-infringement. 9.5 Neither party will be liable for failure or
          delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its
          reasonable control. 9.6 If any term (or part of a term) of these
          Controller Terms is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the rest of
          these Controller Terms will remain in effect. 9.7 These Controller
          Terms will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of
          California without reference to its conflict of law principles. In the
          event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules and regulations, and
          California law, rules and regulations, California law, rules and
          regulations will prevail and govern. Each party agrees to submit to
          the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa
          Clara County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
          for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer
          Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Controller Terms.
          9.8 All notices of termination or breach must be in English, in
          writing and addressed to the other party’s Legal Department. The
          address for notices to Google’s Legal Department is
          legal-notices@google.com. Notice will be treated as given on receipt,
          as verified by written or automated receipt or by electronic log (as
          applicable). 9.9 No party will be treated as having waived any rights
          by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under these
          Controller Terms. No party may assign any part of these Controller
          Terms without the written consent of the other, except to an Affiliate
          where: (a) the assignee has agreed in writing to be bound by the terms
          of these Controller Terms; (b) the assigning party remains liable for
          obligations under these Controller Terms if the assignee defaults on
          them; (c) in the case of Customer, the assigning party has transferred
          its Measurement Services account(s) to the assignee; and (d) the
          assigning party has notified the other party of the assignment. Any
          other attempt to assign is void. 9.10 The parties are independent
          contractors. These Controller Terms do not create any agency,
          partnership, or joint venture between the parties. These Controller
          Terms do not confer any benefits on any third party unless they
          expressly state that they do. 9.11 To the extent permitted by
          applicable law, these Controller Terms state all terms agreed between
          the parties. In entering into these Controller Terms no party has
          relied on, and no party will have any right or remedy based on, any
          statement, representation or warranty (whether made negligently or
          innocently), except those expressly stated in these Controller Terms.
