        Founder, Sapna Blesson is a working mom juggling her family and 2 kids.
        She was working in a fast paced start-up as founding engineer with 1 and
        half hour travel. She is ambitious at the same time, she want to be a
        good mother for her children. <br />
        As an immigrant, her parents and siblings are in India. She felt
        helpless in many situations, she need a community. She want to get some
        support from other parents as well as offer support when she can. But
        there is no way to connect to other parents in classNameroom. Kids will
        be going in different afterschool.
        <br /> Her daughter wants to go to friends birthday party. But she don't
        know how to contact other parent. Her son wants to have playdate with
        his friend in classNameroom. Again, no way to connect to parent. Parents
        pick-up and drop-off kids at different times. <br />
        Most of parents are always rushing. Sometimes, it is hard to initialize
        conversation. She thought to herself. This is the world of internet,
        social media. Still there is no solution to these problems. She decided
        to create it. She quit her job and started building the website hoping
        her mission to connect parents will make deeper connection within
        families in school.{' '}
